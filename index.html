          In December 1891, Canadian physical education teacher James Naismith created basketball at Springfield
          College in Massachusetts to keep his students active during the winter. Using a peach basket nailed to a
          pole as a goal, the first game was played with two half-bushel peach baskets, resulting in a 1-0
          score.<br /><br />Naismith&#39;s
          basic rules were published in 1892, leading to widespread interest and adoption of the sport. Initially,
          there were no set rules or maximum number of players, with Naismith adapting the game based on observation.
          Today, a sculpture in Springfield commemorates the historic game, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall
          of Fame stands as a tribute to the sport&#39;s legacy.

        <p class="the-objective-of">
          The objective of today&#39;s game stems directly from Naismith&#39;s original rules that are based around
          shooting a ball through a metal hoop suspended above the ground, which is called a basket. These basic rules
          include;

        <p class="point-guard-PG-point">
          Point guard (PG)&nbsp;&nbsp;: Point guards are responsible for leading the team on offense. They
          have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to take the ball out (to dribble the ball halfway across their
          team&#39;s court side into the opposing team&#39;s court side) and plan an &#34;attack&#34; or
          &#34;play&#34;.<br /><br />Shooting guard (SG)&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;Shooting guards generally are a
          little bit taller and slower than point guards. They have to make good shots from far distances (like
          three-point lines).<br /><br />Small forward (SF)&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;Small forwards are generally
          taller than both point guards and shooting guards. They are the team&#39;s most versatile player, doing
          everything from rebounding and assisting to scoring.<br /><br />Power forward
          (PF)&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;Power forwards are usually one of the strongest players who play inside the
          3-point line. Their job is to receive rebounds from under the basket and score in the opposing team&#39;s
          basket, although it is unusual for a power forward to score most points for the team.<br /><br />Center
          (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;Centers will usually be the tallest player on the team. They score close to the
          basket, rebound and block shots on the defensive end. They also start the game in the tip off.

        <p class="p">
          In professional basketball teams, each player has a position. A position is a job or role that a player has
          to take part in to play the game.
